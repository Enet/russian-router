# russian-router
Russian router is an abstract javascript router. Despite of the a list of methods the package has powerful features. The main of ones is **matching and generating uris using the same template**. This router by itself provides only low level API and most likely you need to take a look at another packages like [server-russian-router](https://github.com/Enet/server-russian-router), [browser-russian-router](https://github.com/Enet/browser-russian-router) or [react-russian-router](https://github.com/Enet/react-russian-router).

Documentation, examples and tests will be soon.
